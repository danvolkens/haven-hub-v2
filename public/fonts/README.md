# Font Files

This directory should contain the following font files:

1. **CrimsonText-Regular.ttf** - Used for quote text
2. **Japandi-Light.ttf** - Used for mantra text and logo

## Font Sources

- **Crimson Text**: Available from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text)
- **Japandi**: This appears to be a custom font. You'll need to obtain the font file from your design assets or font provider.

## Installation

1. Download the font files
2. Place them in this directory (`/public/fonts/`)
3. The master renderer will automatically load them at startup

## Note

Font files are not included in the repository due to licensing. Make sure to add them before running the master renderer.
